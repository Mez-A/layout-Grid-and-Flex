.reviews-wrapper {
        grid-column: 3/4;
        grid-row: 2/3;
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 40px 40px 300px 40px 40px 40px;
        grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 50px);
        gap: 2rem;
    }
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more on responsive websites with multiple pages.
